maybe there is something wrong with the testcase

judge large always one case is wrong

the 3rd below, but same as 1st and 4th, no reason

[-3,-3,-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0]	[-3,-2,-1,0]	[-3,-2,-1,0]	
   
[-3,-3,-2]	[-3,-2]	[-3,-2]	
   
[-3,-3,-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0]	[-3,-2,-1]	[-3,-2,-1,0]	
   
[-3,-3,-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0]	[-3,-2,-1,0]	[-3,-2,-1,0]
